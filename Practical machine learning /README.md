This repository contains all the necessary files for the **Practical Machine Learning** course project, offered by Johns Hopkins University on Coursera. The project focuses on analyzing the **Weight Lifting Exercise Dataset** as part of the final assignment.

### Key Files:

1. **pml-coursera-project.Rmd**: This is the R Markdown file that contains the complete analysis, including code and narrative, documenting the steps taken to analyze the dataset. It provides a detailed walkthrough of the methods used, data preprocessing, and model development.

2. **pml-coursera-project.html**: This is the compiled HTML version of the R Markdown file, allowing for easy viewing of the analysis in a web browser. It presents the results, including visualizations, model performance, and conclusions. To view this file, the reviewer should:
   - Click the green "Clone or download" button on the repository page.
   - Download the repository files as a `.zip` archive.
   - Extract the files and open `pml-coursera-project.html` in a web browser.

3. **pml-coursera-project.md**: This markdown file provides a simplified version of the analysis, designed to give reviewers a quick overview without the need to run any code or open the full HTML report. It contains the key highlights and conclusions from the project.

4. **pml-training.csv** and **pml-testing.csv**: These CSV files are the original datasets used in the analysis. The training dataset (`pml-training.csv`) was used to build the machine learning model, while the testing dataset (`pml-testing.csv`) was used for validating the model's predictions.

5. **testing_with_predictions.csv**: This file contains the `pml-testing.csv` dataset along with the predicted values for the `classe` variable, generated by the Random Forest model built during the analysis. The `classe` variable indicates different exercise classifications, and the file shows how well the model performs on unseen data.

In summary, this repository provides all the necessary resources for understanding the analysis performed in the Practical Machine Learning course project. Reviewers can access both the original datasets and the results of the Random Forest model applied to the test set, alongside detailed documentation of the entire analysis process.
